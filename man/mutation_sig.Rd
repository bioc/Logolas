\title{Compositional mutational signature data, with mismatch and flanking base
frequencies reported
A dataset of compositional weights for mismatches in the "0"the position 
(center of signature) and
that of the bases A, C, G, T for two left flanking bases (-1, -2) and two 
right flanking bases (1, 2).}
\format{A matrix with 10 rows (4 bases and 6 types of mismatches) and 
5 columns (center - 0, flanking bases
1,2 on the left and flanking bases 1, 2 on the right of the center)}
